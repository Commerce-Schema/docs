# Community Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all Commerce Schema Community spaces, both online and offline. This includes Slack, Discourse, code repositories, Office Hours, Hackathons, and Meetups. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by this Code of Conduct.

This Code of Conduct is based upon [dbt Labs' Code of Conduct](https://docs.getdbt.com/community/resources/code-of-conduct). dbt has created a healthy, inclusive community that we seek to immulate.


This Code of Conduct has two sections:

- **Commerce Schema Community Values:** These values apply to all of our community spaces, and all of our guidelines are based on these values.
- **Anti-harassment policy:**  We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone in our community — here, we outline exactly what that means.

We appreciate your support in continuing to build a community we’re all proud of.

— The Commerce Schema Community Admin Team.

## Commerce Schema Community Values
### Create more value than you capture.

Each community member should strive to create more value in the community than they capture. This is foundational to being a community.

### Be you.

Some developer communities allow and even encourage anonymity — we prefer it when people identify themselves clearly. It helps to build empathy, and form relationships.

Ways to demonstrate this value:

- Update your profile on Commerce Schema Community platforms to include your name and a clear picture of yourself. Where available, use the "what I do" section to add your role, title and current company.
- Write in your own voice, and offer your own advice, rather than speaking in your company’s marketing or support voice.

### Encourage diversity and participation.

People with different mindsets and experiences, working together, create better outcomes. This includes diversity of race and gender, as well as the diversity of academic and career backgrounds, socio-economic backgrounds, geographic backgrounds, ideologies, and interests.

Ways to demonstrate this value:

- Make everyone in our community feel welcome, regardless of their background, and do everything possible to encourage participation in our community.
- Demonstrate empathy for a community member’s experience — not everyone comes from the same career background, so adjust answers accordingly.
- If you are sourcing speakers for events, put in additional effort to find speakers from underrepresented groups.

### Be curious.

Always ask yourself "why?" and strive to be continually learning.

Ways to demonstrate this value:

- Try solving a problem yourself before asking for help, e.g. rather than asking "what happens when I do X", experiment and observe the results!
- When asking questions, explain the "why" behind your decisions, e.g. "I’m trying to solve X problem, by writing Y code. I’m getting Z problem"

## Anti-harassment policy

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Harassment includes:

- Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.
- Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
- Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.
- Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.
- Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like "*hug*" or "*backrub*") without consent or after a request to stop.
- Threats of violence.
- Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.
- Deliberate intimidation.
- Stalking or following.
- Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.
- Sustained disruption of discussion.
- Unwelcome sexual attention.
- Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
- Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.
- Deliberate "outing" of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.
- Publication of non-harassing private communication.

Be mindful that others may not want their image or name on social media. Ask permission prior to posting about another person at in-person events.

The Commerce Schema Community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The Commerce Schema Community Admin team reserves the right not to act on complaints regarding:

- ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as "leave me alone," "go away," or "I’m not discussing this with you."
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions

### Reporting harassment

If you are being harassed by a member of the Commerce Schema Community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact us on Slack.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Commerce Schema community members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.

### Consequences
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the Commerce Schema Community Admin team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all Commerce Schema Community spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other Commerce Schema Community members or the general public.
